# Objective

This project aims to implement best coding practices by refactoring an existing solution. I won't need to code entirely from scratch, as I have been provided with a `churn_notebook.ipynb` file that contains the solution for identifying credit card customers likely to churn. However, this solution does not yet follow software engineering and coding best practices.

My task is to refactor the `churn_notebook.ipynb` file, following best coding practices, to generate the following files:

- `churn_library.py`
- `churn_script_logging_and_tests.py`
- `README.md`

## Starter Files

Hereâ€™s the file structure available to me in the workspace:

The `Guide.ipynb` and `churn_notebook.ipynb` are my starting points for this project.
